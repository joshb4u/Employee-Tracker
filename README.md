A command line interface (CLI) application called Employee Tracker is created here that allows users to manage their company's database using node, express, inquirer and MySQL. The application allows user to view, add, update, and remove employees, roles, or departments by choosing the corresponding options in the CLI. The database schema and structure are saved in the file "schema.sql" and the initial database data is saved in "seed.sql" file. The application's startup file is saved as index.js which uses local dependencies saved as db.js, dispData.js and prompts.js which are saved inside the Assets/JS folder. The start property is also added in the package.json script.
